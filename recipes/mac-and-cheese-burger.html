            <h4>Steps:</h4>   
            <p>Mac and Cheese Buns</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook pasta according to the package directions. Drain and return to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on medium-low heat. Add the milk, garlic and cheddar cheese, stirring until creamy. Remove from heat to cool and thicken for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with parchment. Place a 10 cm circular cookie (bun size) on top and spoon cooled mac and cheese into to 2 cm thickness. Lift off the cookie cutter and repeat for 5 more pieces. Place the baking sheet into the freezer for at least 2 hours to harden.</li>
                    <li>Add 5 cm of oil to a pot or deep fryer and heat to 180°C. Line a large plate with paper towel and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Set up three shallow bowls with flour, egg and breadcrumbs. Dredge one piece of mac and cheese first in flour, then egg and finally breadcrumbs. Using tongs, place the breaded mad and cheese into the hot oil.</li>
                    <li>Fry for 1-2 minutes per side or until golden brown before removing to the paper towel lined plate. Repeat for the remaining pieces of mac and cheese. Put the buns in the oven for 5 minutes to ensure they're fully cocked in the centre</li>
                </ol>
            <p>Burger Patties</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix the beef with the onion and garlic.Season the beef with salt and pepper and form into patties. Place a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and fry the burgers to your desired doneness, about 2-4 minutes per side.</li>
                    <li>Place each burger between two mac and cheese buns. Garnish with optional tomato slices, onions and condiments. Serve immediately.</li>
